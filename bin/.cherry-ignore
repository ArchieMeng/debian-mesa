# These patch were already cherry-picked before the 10.2.4 release.
#
# But get-pick-list.sh doesn't realize that because the commit messages for
# these on the stable branch reference commit IDs that don't actually appear
# on master. I'm not sure what happened, (perhaps master was force-pushed at
# some point?).
