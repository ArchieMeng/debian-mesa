Description: A free implementation of the OpenGL API -- runtime
 Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to
 that of OpenGL.  To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command
 syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.  However, the author makes no claim that Mesa
 is in any way a compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.
 .
 This library provides a pure software rasteriser; it does not provide
 a direct rendering-capable library, or one which uses GLX.  For that,
 please see libgl1-mesa-glx.
 .
 On Linux, this library is also known as libGL or libGL.so.1.

Description: Mesa Off-screen rendering extension
 OSmesa is a Mesa extension that allows programs to render to an
 off-screen buffer using the OpenGL API without having to create a
 rendering context on an X Server.  It uses a pure software renderer.
 .
 This package provides both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the off-screen
 renderer which do not require external libraries to work.

Description: The OpenGL utility library (GLU)
 GLU offers simple interfaces for building mipmaps; checking for the
 presence of extensions in the OpenGL (or other libraries which follow
 the same conventions for advertising extensions); drawing
 piecewise-linear curves, NURBS, quadrics and other primitives
 (including, but not limited to, teapots); tesselating surfaces; setting
 up projection matrices and unprojecting screen coordinates to world
 coordinates.
 .
 On Linux, this library is also known as libGLU or libGLU.so.1.
 .
 This package provides the SGI implementation of GLU shipped with the
 Mesa package (ergo the "-mesa" suffix).

Package: mesa-swx11-source
Section: libdevel
Architecture: all
Description: Mesa software rasteriser source -- development support files
 This package contains the source to the Mesa software rasteriser, which
 implements all of Mesa's GL support in software.  It powers the X11 and
 X server backends (assuming unaccelerated indirect).  This package is
 provided mainly for modular X servers which support GL, and need the
 software rasteriser source to build the GLcore module for unaccelerated
 indirect rendering.
